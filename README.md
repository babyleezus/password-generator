# password-generator
Assignment 5 of Front End Develepment Bootcamp

I created a random password generator where users can create secure and complex passwords by selecting which characters they want the final password to include and also select the length of the final password. Once these values are inputted, clicking the generate password button will display a randomly generated password. 

Below is a screenshot of the final webpage.
